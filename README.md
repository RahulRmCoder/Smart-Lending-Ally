## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- 16 GB RAM (recommended)
- Intel Core i7 processor or equivalent

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-lending-ally.git
cd smart-lending-ally
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn xgboost pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the main notebook:
```bash
smart_lending_ally.ipynb
```

### Quick Start

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch `smart_lending_ally.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment

2. **Run all cells**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the synthetic dataset
   - Train the dual-model classification system
   - Generate loan recommendations

3. **Customize input profiles**: Modify the applicant profile in the notebook:
```python
# Example profile (modify in the notebook)
profile = {
    'age': 42,
    'monthly_income': 150000,
    'cibil_score': 810,
    'loan_type': 'Home',
    'loan_amount': 8000000,
    'employment_years': 15
    # ... other features
}
```

4. **View results**: The notebook will generate:
   - Eligibility predictions for all 10 banks
   - Suitability scores and rankings
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Detailed recommendations with explanations

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Model Performance
- **Average Accuracy**: 98.33% across all banks
- **Recommendation Precision**: 96.7% when validated against expert evaluations
- **Processing Time**: Real-time recommendations
- **Scalability**: Handles diverse user profiles effectively

### Key Improvements Over Existing Systems
- **20-28% higher accuracy** compared to single-algorithm systems (70-87%)
- **Comprehensive suitability scoring** beyond basic eligibility
- **Transparent explanations** for all recommendations
- **Dynamic weighting** based on loan type priorities

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

**Suitability Score Calculation:**
```
S(P,B) = wE¬∑E(P,B) + wI¬∑I(P,B) + wP¬∑P(P,B) + wA¬∑A(P,B)
```

Where:
- E(P,B): Eligibility component (0-1)
- I(P,B): Interest rate favorability (0-1)  
- P(P,B): Processing efficiency (0-1)
- A(P,B): Affordability component (0-1)
- w: Loan-type specific weights

**Financial Ratios:**
- Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): `CurrentEMI / MonthlyIncome`
- Loan-to-Income Ratio (LTI): `LoanAmount / AnnualIncome`

### Dependencies

The main notebook requires the following Python libraries:

```
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
xgboost>=1.7.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
seaborn>=0.12.0

    'monthly_income': 150000,
    'cibil_score': 810,
    'loan_type': 'Home',
    'loan_amount': 8000000,
    'employment_years': 15,

# Modify the profile in the notebook for car loan scenario
profile = {
    'age': 28,
    'monthly_income': 45000,
    'cibil_score': 720,
    'loan_type': 'Car',
    'loan_amount': 800000,
    'employment_years': 3
